Instructions on how to play hangman:


User is given a blank word. 

The blank word uses underscores to indicate to the user the number of letters in the word as the first clue.

User gets 10 attempts to guess one letter to see if it is in the word. 

If the letter is in the word, the program will tell the user where exactly the letter is in the word.

The user can guess the full word at any point in the game to win.

If the user does not guess the word in 10 tries, they lose the game.
